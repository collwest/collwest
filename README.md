<!--
**collwest/collwest** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a school project
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code and create databases 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to get started on github
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about what I am learning. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am still in school.
